# Honey 1 Hour Game

This is a quick little game made in a couple of hours to test out the current state of [Honey](https://github.com/CleverSource/Honey).

## Notes
Tested in Debug and Release. Open `Honey.sln` and run the `Sandbox` project. Alternatively you can run `scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat` to generate new project files. The current commit is an _exact_ submission of what I achieved within the timeframe. I may modify this in the future to make it a little more polished, as well as provide a debrief of my experiences and what I think should be prioritized for Honey's future development.

Honey is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented.
